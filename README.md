# Unity Chemical Engine
A VR Chemical Reaction & Experiments Simulation Application Developed by Unity3D

## How to Play
1. Download the application from [here](http://www.google.com) and extract the files. 

2. There are 2 executable files with different contents, which will be introduced later.

3. If you have HTC valve, open the game with your steam VR. If not, just run it directly on your PC and use the simulator inside the game. Detailed controlling mappings are intruduced in the game.

## What can the engine do
This engine support multiple reactions and single experiment with detailed instructions. Besides, the engine has good scalability because all the reactants and reactions are configured in an xml file. All the reacting information (quantity, reactant name, reactions, etc.) will be displayed. 

### Reactions
1. Fe + HCl -> FeCl2 + O2 -> FeCl3 
  The color of the solution will change in accordance to the react process. The Fe in the liquid will dissolve as well. 
 
2. NO2 <-> N2O4
  The color of the system wiil change due to pressure of the system, which can be adjusted by the user.

3. Explode
  It is based on 2 complicated organics and H2SO4.
 
### Experiment
We implement the experiment which we heat KMnO4 to create O2.

#### The details can be viewed clearly in the video
